# Dispatch Mapping for Emergency Responders #

### Know Where You Are Going And How To Get There ###

## Summary ##
  A web application for emergency responders that sends your emergency calls to your phone, complete
  with essential call details and a Google map of the location.

## Problem ##
  As a driver of an emergency response vehicle responding to a call, you do
  not always know where you are going. Even experienced responders with many
  years on the job do not know every street. Sometimes you have to consult a
  map, which can be time consuming and delay the response.

## Solution ##
  Dispatch Mapping sends basic call details and a Google map directly to the
  first responders phone within seconds of your Dispatch Center's call
  dispatch. The map
  pinpoints the call and the first responder's location with markers and a
  route line so the first responder can quickly and easily determine how to
  get to the call.

## Quote from You ##
  "I developed this software because as a career firefighter that drives a fire
  engine to emergency calls, I know how frustrating it can be to not know
  where you are going, especially in situations where lives may be at stake
  and every second matters. Dispatch Mapping gives me that quick look at the
  map so that I instantly know where I am going."

## How to Get Started ##
  Two easy steps to get started:
  1. Have your Dispatch Center post basic call details to our webserver's API
  2. Add names and mobile phone numbers for your first responders to the Admin
     page that you administer.

  We take care of the rest. You will soon start receiving SMS texts for each call
  that is dispatched from your call center.

## Customer Quote ##
  "Until we got Dispatch Mapping, we still had a paper map taped to the wall
  and I'd estimate that we'd have to look at that map for about 20-30% of our
  calls. New employees were looking even more. Now all of our employees
  receive a text on their phone every time there's a call. They get basic call
  info and a map showing the call location. We don't get lost anymore on the
  way to calls, and we've seen our response times improve by 25%."
